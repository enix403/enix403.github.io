# Introduction

Hello

```py
def double(x: float):
    return x * 2
```

This is list

  - One
  - Two
  - `Three`

Now some math

$$
\text{C}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}T_i(1 - \text{exp}(-\sigma_i\delta_i))\mathbf{c}_i
$$

where $\delta_i = t_{i+1} - t_{i}$ is the distance between consective query points $t_i$. This function reduces to traditional alpha compositing with alpha values $\alpha_i = 1 - \text{exp}(-\sigma_i\delta_i)$.
